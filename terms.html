<p align="center"><big><strong><big>Terms and Conditions</big></strong></big></p>

<p><u><strong><big>Purchase<br>
</big></strong></u><strong>An instrument does not become the property of the buyer until the payment is
cleared.<br>
If the instrument is returned to me within one week in the condition it was sold, then the
purchase price will be refunded, <br>
less a £10 restocking fee (since I will have to examine and clean the instrument again
before it can be resold).</strong></p>

<p><b>I am happy to accept&nbsp; payment by cash/bank transfer or cheque 
(subject to clearance), and can accept payment by card, although it costs me 
more!</b></p>

<p><big><u><strong>Trial before Purchase<br>
</strong></u></big><strong>If required, an instrument can be reserved until a purchaser has time to test
and/or get a teacher or<br>
experienced person to test it at my premises.<br>
In the case of a beginner, I would strongly recommend that the instrument should be tested
by someone knowledgeable.<br>
Instruments will not normally be allowed off the premises until paid for.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u><font size="4">For customers unable to visit my workshop</font></u><br>
I do not send instruments on approval - it is too risky for me.<br>
However, what I do offer is a 14 day trial period from date of invoice, with the 
instrument and carriage<br>
being paid for in full.<br>
During this period, if you find the instrument is not suitable, you may return 
the instrument (at your expense) for a full <br>
refund of purchase price and initial carriage, assuming there is no material 
change to its condition. </strong></p>

<p><big><u><strong>Guarantee Terms<br>
</strong></u></big><strong>For instruments sold any guarantee given applies only if the instrument is not
maltreated in any way, and does not cover accidental damage.<br>
For repairs, the guarantee is limited to the repairs made, and does not apply to the
failure of any part not repaired.<br>
In all cases the guarantee only covers the actual failure, and does not cover any
consequential loss or damage.</strong></p>
